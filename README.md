# Movie Recommender Systems
==============================
## Overview
This project is to implement **Movie Recommender Systems** for [MovieLens 100k dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). In general, recommender systems are based on one of two different strategies, *content filtering* and *collaborative filtering*, respectively.

*Content filtering* approach uses profiles for users and/or products. A movie profile may include its genre, directors, actors and etc, while a user profile might include user's age, gender, demographic information and etc.

Another strategy for recommender systems relies on past users' behaviours such as previous activities or product ratings. This strategy is called *collaborative filtering*.

In this project, we implement 4 different algorithms in *collaborative filtering*.
